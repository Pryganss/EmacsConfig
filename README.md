# Emacs Config
My emacs init.el file

Most of the configuration comes from the youtube series found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ) with a few of my own tweaks. (I know it's terrible you don't have to remind me)

In order to use spotify and youtube you need developer keys for them (instructions for how to find these is on the package's pages), these must be placed in secret.txt in the /.emacs.d/ file in the order shown in secretGuide.txt
